I have been tasked by CTU training solutions to develop a Marks Application for the Facilitators using Java programming language, that will allow facilitators to maintain student’s marks during exams. The application will show students' reports per module, including the marks, class average, lowest marks, highest marks, and a mark distribution bar chart.

• The use of a two-dimensional array should be used to store students’ marks for several tests.
• The use of a constructor should be used to initialize course names and marks.
• The use methods (minimum 5) should be used to implement the functionality of the application, including set and get methods.
• All calculations (average, Lowest, and highest mark) should be calculated based on the student marks.
• The mark distribution should be precise as the student marks.
• The application running without errors/ Use of comments in the coding.
